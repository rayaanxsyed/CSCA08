    <h2>Goals of this Assignment</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Use
	the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/lectures/week02/design_recipe.pdf">Function
	Design Recipe</a> to plan, implement, and test functions.
      </li>
      <li>Write function bodies using variables, numeric types, strings, and conditional
	statements. (You can do this whole assignment with only the concepts from Weeks 1, 2, and 3
	of the course.)
      </li>
      <li>Learn to use Python 3, Wing 101, provided starter code, a checker module, and other tools.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Starter code</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, we are giving you some files, including Python starter code files.
      Please download the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/a1.zip">Assignment 1 Files</a> and extract the zip archive.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two starter code Python files and a Python program that helps you check (<strong>not
      fully test!</strong>) your solutions for Python style violations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <code>tickets.py</code>
	<p>
	  This file contains some code that sets up your use of constants
	  from <code>constants.py</code>, a helper function for you to use (see the table of
	  functions to implement <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/index.html#functions_table">below</a>), <strong>solutions</strong>
	  for several required functions for you to use as examples, as well as <strong>headers and
	  docstrings</strong> (but not bodies) for several function you are to write, to help you
	  get started. Your job is to complete this file.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li> <code>constants.py</code>
	<p>
	  This file contains some useful <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/index.html#constants">constants</a> that you should use in
	  your solution. You will <strong>not</strong> modify this file.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li> <code>a1_checker.py</code>
	<p>
	  This is a checker program that you should use to check your
	  code. See <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/index.html#checker">below</a> for more information
	  about <code>a1_checker.py</code>.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ticket">
      The Airline Ticket
    </h2>

    <p>
      The typical airplane boarding pass contains many different pieces of information, including
      passenger information, seat, flight number, flight time, and so on. In this assignment, we'll
      work with our own version of information you might find on a boarding pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll refer to the data we will work with just as a "ticket". A ticket is a string, where
      different pieces of the string represent different kinds of information. Our ticket will
      include the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The date the ticket is for, including year, month, and day.</li>
      <li>Departure and arrival airport codes of the flight the ticket is for.</li>
      <li>The seat assigned to the ticket, including the row number and the seat within that row.</li>
      <li>The passenger's frequent flyer number, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A valid ticket will have either 17 or 21 characters. Below, we describe what the different
      index ranges mean in a ticket.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> The date of the ticket consists of three pieces of information: year, month, and day.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Characters at indices from <code>YR</code> to <code>YR+3</code>, inclusive, represent
	    the year the ticket is for. In a valid year, these four characters must be digits. We do
	    not place any other restrictions on the validity of the year field.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Characters at indices <code>MON</code> and <code>MON+1</code> represent the month the
	    ticket is for. In a valid month, these two characters must be digits that represent a
	    number between 1 and 12, inclusive.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Characters at indices <code>DAY</code> and <code>DAY+1</code> represent the day the
	    ticket is for. In a valid day, these two characters must be digits that represent a
	    number between 1 and the maximum number of days for the given month and year. Recall
	    that months January, March, May, July, August, October and December have 31 days, months
	    April, June, September, and November have 30 days, and the month of February has 28 days
	    in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year. A leap year is a positive integer
	    multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, but not by 400).
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Characters at indices from <code>DEP</code> to <code>DEP+2</code>, inclusive, represent the
	code of the departure airport. In a valid code, these three characters must be letters.
      </li>
      <li>
	Characters at indices from <code>ARR</code> to <code>ARR+2</code>, inclusive, represent the
	code of the arrival airport. In a valid code, these three characters must be letters. In a
	valid ticket, departure and arrival airports must be different.
      </li>
      <li>
	Characters at indices <code>ROW</code> and <code>ROW+1</code> represent the row number of
	the ticket. In a valid row number, these two characters must be digits.
      </li>
      <li>
	The character at index <code>SEAT</code> represents the seat in a given row. A valid seat is
	the value of one of the
	constants <code>SA</code>, <code>SB</code>, <code>SC</code>, <code>SD</code>, <code>SE</code>,
	or <code>SF</code>, which for us represent seats "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F", but can
	be translated into a different language by changing the values of these constants. Our
	aircrafts all have six seats in each row, with three seats on each side of the
	aisle: <code>SA</code>,
	<code>SB</code>, <code>SC</code> on one side, and <code>SD</code>, <code>SE</code>,
	and <code>SF</code> on the other. Seats <code>SA</code> and <code>SF</code> are window
	seats, seats <code>SB</code> and <code>SE</code> are middle seats, and seats <code>SC</code>
	and <code>SD</code> are aisle seats.
      </li>
      <li>
	Characters starting at index <code>FFN</code> are special and represent the frequent flyer
	number for the passenger this ticket belongs to, if they have one. The value
	of <code>FFN</code> must be 17 on a valid ticket, meaning the frequent flyer number always
	appears as the last record in the ticket string. Some tickets do no have a record for
	frequent flyer number, meaning the corresponding string is the empty
	string <code>''</code>. Some tickets have a record for frequent flyer number, in which case
	this number appears between indices 17 and 20, inclusive. The empty string is a valid
	frequent flyer number. A valid non-empty frequent flyer number must contain exactly four
	digits, and the sum of the first three digits modulo 10 must be the same as the last
	(fourth) digit.
      </li>
      <li> Here are some examples of valid tickets.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Suppose the values of our constants are <code>YR = 0</code>, <code>MON =
	    4</code>, <code>DAY = 6</code>, <code>DEP = 8</code>, <code>ARR = 11</code>, <code>ROW =
	    14</code>, <code>SEAT = 16</code>, and <code>FFN = 17</code>. The ticket below is for
	    December 21, 2023 for a flight from YYZ to YEG in seat 25F. The passenger's flyer number
	    is 4442. (Note that <code>4 + 4 + 4 mod 10 is 2</code>).

<pre>            20231221YYZYEG25F4442</pre>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Suppose now the values of our constants are <code>YR = 10</code>, <code>MON =
	    8</code>, <code>DAY = 6</code>, <code>DEP = 0</code>, <code>ARR = 3</code>, <code>ROW =
	    14</code>, <code>SEAT = 16</code>, and <code>FFN = 17</code>. The ticket below is for
	    September 20, 2024 for a flight from YYZ to LAS in seat 16D. The passenger's flyer number
	    is 4420. (Note that <code>4 + 4 + 2 mod 10 is 0</code>).

<pre>            YYZLAS2009202416D4420</pre>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>
    <p>
      Constants are special variables whose values should not change once assigned. A different
      naming convention (uppercase pothole) is used for constants, so that programmers know to not
      change their values. For example, in the starter code, the constant <code>YR</code> (for
      "year") is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the module and the value
      of <code>YR</code> should never change in your code.  When writing your code, if you need to
      use the index at which a ticket contains the year, you should use <code>YR</code> and not the
      value 1. The same goes for the other constant values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using constants simplifies code modifications and improves readability and changeability.  For
      example, if we later decide to use French instead of English, we would only have to make the
      changes in one place (the <code>WINDOW</code>, <code>AISLE</code>, and <code>MIDDLE</code>
      assignment statements in the file <code>constants.py</code>), rather than throughout the
      program.  This also makes our code more readable â€” whether we use <code>1</code> or any
      other index to store the year on the ticket, we write our code using the
      constant <code>YR</code> so it is clear to the reader what we mean.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should <strong>read the file <code>constants.py</code> carefully</strong> to understand
      the purpose of each defined constant.  You must use these constants in your code and not the
      literal values.  For example, you must use <code>YR</code> instead of <code>0</code> to earn
      full marks.
    </p>

    <h2>What to do</h2>

    <p>
      In the starter code file <code>tickets.py</code>, complete the following function
      definitions. <strong>Note that some are already provided for you to use as examples!</strong>
      Use the Function Design Recipe that you have been learning in this course. We have included
      the type contracts in the following table; please read through the table to understand how the
      functions will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be evaluating your docstrings in addition to your code. Please include <strong>at
      least two examples</strong> in each docstring. You will need to paraphrase the full
      descriptions of the functions to get an appropriate docstring description. Your docstring
      examples should be <strong>valid doctests</strong> â€” we will <strong>run</strong> them
      as part of evaluation of your program.
    </p>

    <h3> Task 1: Getting the Information (7 correctness marks)</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Advice</strong>: Start working on these functions as soon as the assignment is
	released. You have already learned all material needed to complete them.

    <h3> Task 3: Analysing the Information  (12 correctness marks)</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Advice</strong>: Start working on these functions as soon as the assignment is
	released. You can complete the headers and docstrings for all of them now, and then complete
	the implementations after the week of Sep 25 classes are done.

	    The first parameter represents the ticket. The second parameter represents the row

  <h3>Using Constants</h3>
    <p>
      As we discuss in section <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/index.html#constants">Constants</a> above, your code should make use
      of the provided constants. If the value of one of those constants were changed, and your
      program rerun, your functions should work with those new values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if <code>YR</code> were changed, then your functions should work according to the
      new number of bonus points that should be earned for guessing a consonant.  Using constants in
      your code means that this happens automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your docstring examples should reflect the given <strong>values</strong> of the constants in
      the provided starter code, and <strong>do not need to change</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>No Input or Output</h3>
    <p>
      Your <code>tickets.py</code> file should contain the starter code, plus the function
      definitions specified above.
      <code>tickets.py</code> must <em>not</em> include any calls to the <code>print</code>
      and <code>input</code> functions.  Do <em>not</em> add any <code>import</code> statements.
      Also, do <em>not</em> include any function calls or other code outside of the function
      definitions.
    </p>


    <h2 id="checker">A1 Checker</h2>
    <p>
      We are providing a checker module (<code>a1_checker.py</code>) that tests two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	whether your code follows the Python
        <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/python_style_guide.html">style guidelines</a>, and
      </li>
      <li>
	whether your functions are named correctly, have the correct number of parameters, and
	return the correct types.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To run the checker, open <code>a1_checker.py</code> and run it.  Note: the checker file should
      be in the <strong>same</strong> directory as your <code>tickets.py</code>, as provided in the
      starter code zip file.  Be sure to scroll up to the top and read all messages!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If the checker passes for both style and types:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your code follows the style guidelines.
      </li>
      <li>
	Your function names, number of parameters, and return types match the assignment
        specification. <strong>This does not mean that your code works correctly in all
        situations.</strong> We will run a <em>different</em> set of tests on your code once you
        hand it in, so be sure to thoroughly test your code yourself before submitting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>If the checker fails, carefully read the message provided:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>
	 It may have failed because your code did not follow the style guidelines.  Review the error
	 description(s) and fix the code style.  Please see
	 the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/pyta/">PyTA documentation</a> for more
	 information about errors.
       </li>
       <li>
	 It may have failed because:
	 <ul>
	   <li>you are missing one or more functions, </li>
	   <li>one or more of your functions are misnamed,</li>
	   <li>one or more of your functions have incorrect number or types of parameters, or</li>
	   <li>one of more of your functions return values of types that do not match the assignment specification.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>
	   Read the error messages to identify the problematic functions, review the function
	   specifications in the handout, and fix your code.
	 </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Make sure the checker passes before submitting.
    </p>

    <h2>Marking</h2>

    <p>
      These are the aspects of your work that may be marked for A1:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coding style (20%):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
	    Make sure that you follow Python <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/csca08/assignments/a1/python_style_guide.html">style guidelines</a>
            that we have introduced and the Python coding conventions that we have been using
            throughout the semester.  Although we do not provide an exhaustive list of style rules,
            the checker tests for style are complete, so if your code passes the checker, then it
            will earn full marks for coding style with one exception: <em>docstrings will be
            evaluated separately</em>. For each occurrence of a PyTA error, one mark (out of 20)
            deduction will be applied.  For example, if a C0301 (line-too-long) error occurs 3
            times, then 3 marks will be deducted.
	  </li>

          <li>
	    All functions, including helper functions, should have complete docstrings including
	    preconditions when you think they are necessary and at least two valid examples.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li> <strong>Correctness (80%):</strong>
	<p>
	  Your functions should perform as specified. Correctness, as measured by our tests, will
          count for the largest single portion of your marks.  Once your assignment is submitted, we
          will run additional tests not provided in the checker. Passing the checker <strong>does
          not</strong> mean that your code will earn full marks for correctness.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Note that for full marks <strong>all docstring examples you provide should run without
	  producing errors</strong>.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Hand In</h2>

    <p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold;">
      The very last thing you do before submitting should be to run the checker program one last
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes before submitting that causes
      your code to receive zero for correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submit <code>tickets.py</code> on MarkUs by following the instructions on the course
      website. Remember that spelling of filenames, including case, counts: your file must be named
      exactly as above.
